#April 2022 - created via Replit when first learning to code 

The purpose of this simple function is to act as a tool in choosing a pet insurance plan. Because there are many pet insurance companies and each company often offers many different plans, I created this tool to help me quickly calculate whether the plan was a good investment for different scenarios. note: this code does not take into consideration plan options that put a cap on coverage amount. 

##Plan options:

-monthly premium: the monthly cost the insurance company would bill be for being covered under the insurance plan 

-deductible: the amount I must pay out of pocket first before the insurance company will step in and help pay for vet bills 

-reimbursement rate: the percentage of any given vet bill that the insurance company will pay me back 

-minimal yearly expense: the annual cost of having insurance coverage (even if my pet never ends up needing to go to the vet that year), + the deductible amount I am responsible for before I can start using the benefits of insurance coverage 

##Consider your insurance needs:

-identify how much you are able to afford monthly to maintain coverage for your pet (monthly premium)

-if you require a lower monthly premium, are you comfortable with paying a higher deductible? 

-if you require a lower monthly premium, are you comfortable with a lower reimbursement rate?


##Using the code:

-get quotes from insurance companies (most require entering your email address and information on your pet) 

-take note of their plans and options (monthly premium, deductible, reimbursement rate)

-plug in the numbers to the code 

-plug in numbers for a hypothetical vet bill, considering different scenarios such as a small vet bill vs huge vet bill

-use the code results to see how much you would have saved with that specific plan, and whether it was a good deal or not (if you had that coverage vs. no insurance coverage at all)
